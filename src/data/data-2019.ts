Orange & apple juice & still water are just as good, once you get used to it.",

Changed the brake pads, and put on original pads from Kawasaki :) Then we went to the supercross track (which was built for pros), and did some laps there. It was great! But maybe next time I could practice for a day or two on a motocross track... In the afternoon, we went training on the motocross track. I started feeling pretty good on the bike, but the other riders were so much faster. I tried to match their pace, at least for 3-4 turns... No chance. I later found out that these riders were pro riders (Bowers, Wharton, McElrath, Smith, Cantrell, Falk, Cooper, ...), riding without numbers on their jerseys, or without numbers on their bikes.',

It was another dream come true, to be behind the starting gate at the Las Vegas supercross! Unfortunately, I got hurt in a silly accident in the stadium, where I hurt my head, shoulder, ribs, hips, legs, and both of my ankles very hard (a wonder they didn't break...).

Then I worked my magic, and got from 7th to first in half a lap. And then the adrenalin vanished, and the pain started coming back. I managed to salvage an 9th place (8th place in points, because there as a rider with a day license in front of me). The second race was similar - bad start (I think I was in 4th or 5th), after half a lap I was 1st, and after the race 8th again. After the race, my brother Nicola rode the bike back - I simply couldn't hold on any longer. You win your championships on your bad days, as Ricky Carmichael always said...",
